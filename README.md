# Data-Science-Trends-2020

Curious of the latest programming language trends in data science, I scraped the Towards Data Science archives from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 which amounted to 11,579 articles. The code for this can be found in the 'Web-Scraper' file. You can download the data here: https://datapane.com/hajime_153/reports/medium_tds_articles/.

For my analysis, I answered two main questions:

1) What are the most talked about programming languages in 2020?
2) What topics are these languages covering in 2020?

The code for my analysis can be found in the 'Analysis' file.
