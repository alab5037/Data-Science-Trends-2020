# Data-Science-Trends-2020

Have you ever found it difficult to keep up with the latest technologies and trends in data science? This has been true for me especially when it comes to programming languages. As the needs of data scientist change and evolve, languages take on new features or modify existing ones. So, I wondered:

1) What are the most talked about programming languages in 2020?
2) What topics are these languages covering in 2020?

To answer these questions, I scraped 10k+ Towards Data Science (TDS) publications on Medium. Not only does TDS have a large amount of data science content, but I find that it does a good job in covering the latest data science trends. Ultimately, I believe that staying informed of these trends is an important way to keep your technical skills up to date.
